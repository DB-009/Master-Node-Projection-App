# Master-Node-Projection-App
An Html/JS webb app that projects earnings for node systems.

The following is a preview of what the chart looks like when a node has been purchased for the month.
on the far right with the red background is what you actually made for that month.
the ones under it are updated projected earnings. to the right of that is new node count.
everything else is pretty self explanitory due to the labels.
