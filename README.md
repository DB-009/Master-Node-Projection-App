**Monthly payout Preview**

The following is a preview of what the chart looks like when a node has been purchased for the month(the last row).
(above it is a month where one wasnt able to be afforded.)
on the far right with the red background is what you actually made for that month.
if you notice the one above doesnt have one because earnings hadnt changed.
the ones under it are updated projected earnings. to the right of that is new node count.
everything else is pretty self explanitory due to the labels.
